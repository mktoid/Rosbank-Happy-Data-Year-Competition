My solution for LB #16 of 292

1. OpenStreetMap for geo features (distances to tagged offices, parkings, cemeteries etc.) using osmread
2. Russian Post website scraping (Postal codes, address normalization) using Selenium
3. Yandex Geocoder API (adresses to latitude/longitude, administrative areas) using requests and Beautiful Soup
4. Scraping Alfa-Bank website (ATM locations, JSON) using requests
5. Official data on average region salary and population, gensim and FastText to deal with misprints, abbreviations in avalable Excel files
